--Journal Week 2--
This week we started on learning the basics of java script. We started out by learning about the origins of Java Script including why it was called "Java" Scrpit (to get recognition) and how it has changed over the year as it grows in popularity. After learning about the history Java Script we focused on the first key aspect of it, variables.

What have we learned?

>Creating comments
Creating comments allowed a dev to set lines of code or text to be ignored and not run by the program. This allows devs to write helpful comments in their code so it can be easily understood what a paticular line of code or variable is doing or being used for.

>Creating variables
This week in groups of two we learned how to create and set new variables as either numbers or a string of character in Java Script. Next we learned how to combine these variables together to create messages or preform mathmatical calculations and store the result in a new variable which can pe printed to the console by using the console.log() command.

>Different types of variables and the difference between them
We also learned the diffrent types of variables in Java Script, these include:
    -Var
    Var is the standard form of variable used by Java Script. It can be set and edited at any time while the program runs.
    -Let
    Let is the new form of Var and can be edited the same way, Let is superiour to var because it does not encounter the same problems var does with scope.
    -Const
    Const is diffrent to the other two variables because once it is set it is effectivly locked and cannot be changed 

What challenges did I encounter?

This week I found reasonably easy as I have used Java Script in a limmited capacity before and understand some of its concepts. The only two things I found difficult where understanding how let and const where diffrent from var but this was immediatly cleared up as soon as I put them to practical use (thats ussualy the only way I can really learn).

The second thing I found difficult was working in a pair with someone who has had alot more experience coding than I have, this was became difficult when we had to create a console.log(); that calculated all of our variables in one line (within the .log()). Once my partner had written out the full .log() I said we needed to use additional brackets to stagger the calculation or the program would not calculate in the correct order and output the wrong result but my partner didnt see why their should be an issue. I felt my partner didnt listen to me at all at this point because it took him a good 15min to come to the same conclusion as me and then proceded to figure out the problem and solution himself while I repeatedly told him what the problem was and what the solution is. 

Next time I will be better able to communicate/instruct my partner by getting them to check their results themselfs and only then suggesting a solution so their is less confusion.
